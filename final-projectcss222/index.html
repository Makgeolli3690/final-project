    <h1>2022 Spring</h1>
    <br>
    <hr color="black" />
    <p class="BigL">DRX'x spring roster was relatively shaky. DRX was not a team well known for winning. DRX came in fourth in the Spring season, coming in fourth out of 10 teams going 11 wins and 8 losses. DRX's roster didn't have one star player, who won one world's championships in 2020. This was not impressive at all compared to T1's impressive historic record of 18 wins and 0 losses. T1 had five star players who built their reputation from their high end skills. Nobody was talking about DRX's performance in the Spring season. They did not qualify for the Midterm Season Invitational, which is the second largest annual competition, while T1 went second after losing to the defending champions from China's RNG.</p>

    <h1>Fall/2022 World Championship</h1>
    <p class="BigL">Korea was allowed to send four League of Legends teams to the World Championship tournament. There were three teams already chosen to compete, and DRX had to play a tiebreaker to win the fourth spot. DRX played a very long qualifiers by playing 5 games in a best of 3 match. As the fourth seed of Korea's teams, DRX had to compete against teams from other countries to secure its spot to the World Championship bracket. They had to compete in Mexico while the other three teams rested comfortably in the US. DRX was expected to lose the first competitor, who were the defending champions of World's 2021. DRX won, and competed against GenG, a Korean team that was expected to win the tournament due to its spectacular fall season. GenG  defeated T1 3:0 in a best of three for the Korean Cup. DRX defeated GenG, and went to compete in the finals against T1. T1 had the worl'd greatest League of Legend player of all time named Faker, and everyone congratulated DRX for making it this far, and automatically thought that T1 will be the winners. Faker had three World's Championship titles compared to 1 title for the rest of his competitors. He is nicknamed the Unkillable Demon King because he destroys the enemy team like a Demon while not dying. However, DRX won the best of three against T1. DRX became the first team in history to win the World's Championships as a fourth seed in a location, and were named the underdogs that slayed the Unkillable Demon King.</p>
